## Project Outline <a name="Outline"></a>
- This is a loot box simulator created using p5.js, Javascript, and Arduino. It is coded in Javascript using the p5.js library, and it uses Arduino software/hardware for physical interaction. The player can use either a joystick or mouse to open loot boxes, and amass a collection of LSU themed items. Along with the joystick for input, Arduino hardware is also used to light LEDs corresponding to the rarity of the pulled item.

## Narrative Description <a name="NarrativeDescription"></a>
- The game is set in the streets of LSU. The player must navigate the streets as a small squirrel trying to avoid the orange scooter obstacles. The objective is to move forward as much as possible, with each step forward accounting for a point. The 
player can either move up, down, left, or right to help avoid obstacles. The player has 3 lives, each of which are represented by an LED light on the arduino. Each life lost will result in a LED turning off. The game ends when either all 3 lives or lost
or when the player reaches a score of 30.
