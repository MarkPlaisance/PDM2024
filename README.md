This is a loot box game created using p5.js, Javascript, and Arduino. It is coded in Javascript using the p5.js library, and it uses Arduino software/hardware for physical interaction. The player can use either a joystick or mouse to open loot boxes, and amass a collection of LSU themed items. Along with the joystick for input, Arduino hardware is also used to light LEDs corresponding to the rarity of the pulled item.
